// Declaring a method:
// Methods in Go are functions associated with a specific type (usually structs).
// The method must have a receiver, which allows it to operate on an instance of the type.
// You can declare methods on any type, such as structs or interfaces, but itâ€™s most common with structs.
// func () nameOfMethod(Parameter) returnType {}

// Here we are using a pointer to the struct because we want to modify the original struct.
// This method is similar to a setter, and since it uses a pointer receiver, 
// the changes to the fields will persist.
func (u *user) setData(name string, age int) {
	u.name = name
	u.age = age
}

// Without pointer, changing the name
// This method uses a value receiver, so it returns a new copy of the struct with the updated name.
// To see the updated name, you must reassign the variable.
func (u user) setName(newName string) user {
	u.name = newName
	return u
